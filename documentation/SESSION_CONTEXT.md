# PosX Developer Session Ready Reckoner

**Date:** October 11, 2025

## Current Focus
- Technical documentation for PosX-main (`POSX_TECHNICAL.md`) is fully restructured and professionally ordered.
- All major modules, API contracts, data models, business logic, troubleshooting, and changelog are documented.
- Field directory and code references are included for fast developer onboarding.
- Redundant markdown files have been deleted; only main technical docs remain.

## Next Steps
- Continue refining documentation for deeper code walkthroughs or add more code samples if requested.
- Apply similar improvements to backend documentation (`POSX-ERPNEXT_TECHNICAL.md`) if needed.
- Assist with any new features, bug fixes, or integration tasks as directed.
- Support exporting docs, onboarding new developers, or any workflow automation.

## How to Resume
- Review the latest version of `POSX_TECHNICAL.md` and `POSX-ERPNEXT_TECHNICAL.md`.
- Reference the changelog and troubleshooting sections for context.
- Pick up from the last documented section or user request.

## Session Context
- User expects fast, in-depth, and actionable technical guidance.
- Documentation is the current focus, but code, architecture, and integration support are ongoing.
